Excel sheets have been set up to easily feed data to the database. These file can be found at LoadingV2/LoadingAPI/Admin/Datafiles.

When running the backend (dotnet watch), the data currently in the three databases (answers, characterStat, questions) will be cleared out and replaced with data provided in the excel sheets.
Oops! The excel files need to be closed before running the server, and cannot be changed during runtime without running dotnet watch again.

Each row represents an entry in the database, where the first row represents the table names and must never be changed (!!!).

To setup questions, answers and characters for the play, 3 excel files has been created which will connect to the database during runtime. 
These files can be located at LoadingV2/LoadingAPI/Admin/Datafiles.

When the server starts, all previous data from the mentioned databases will be removed and replaced with the data in the corresponding excel file, allowing for easy changes and backup.

OBS!
Do NOT change the header (first row) in excel as this corresponds to the database columns.
ALWAYS close the excel sheets before running the server, also note that changes made while the server is running will not be implemented, only when the server restarts.

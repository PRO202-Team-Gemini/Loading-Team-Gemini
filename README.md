> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run this project locally on your computer, you'll need to follow these steps:

First, start with opening the integrated terminal in **"LoadingReact"** folder.

Then, you'll need to install npm (Node Package Manager).

Run:
```sh
npm install
```
then run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

To start the connection to the database, you'll need to open the integrated terminal in **"LoadingAPI"**

Run:
```sh
dotnet watch
```

This will migrate the database to the prosject and open Swagger in your browser.
Swagger displays the API's endpoints. You don't have to do anything on that page.

The project is now running locally on your computer.
